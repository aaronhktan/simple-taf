# Simple TAF

A simple and beautiful way to view TAFs.

### What are TAFs?
According to Google, a METAR "is a concise statement of the expected meteorological conditions at an airport during a specified period (usually 24 hours)". Basically, weather forecasts for pilots.

### OK, how do I use it?
Simple - find the ICAO code for the station that you want to check the TAF for, or just let the browser determine your location.
